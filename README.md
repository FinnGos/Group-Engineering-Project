# Carbo - Sustainability Game

## Description:
🎮 Welcome to **Carbo**! This is our task-based collectibles sustainability game. In this game, you will be given a few tasks to complete each day on the University of Exeter campus. Each task will relate to a way you can contribute to better sustainability, such as recycling or reducing energy consumption, to help contribute to a greener campus. You can also take part in riddles and treasure hunts visiting significant sites on campus.

All of these will earn you **CarboPoints** that you can spend to unlock **CarboCards** and climb to the top of the leaderboards. These collectibles will highlight key locations, Sustainable Development Goals, and other aspects of our university.

There are many cards to collect, points to earn, and fun facts to be learned, so good luck and have fun!
