This is specifically for github actions 
this is very cool and Colum will like it 

We want to set this up to automatically run tests to ensure nothing breaks on a push
Basically whenever we push to a branch we run this file which does what we tell it to 
We can either have a production branch we commonly push to and run a set of tests to ensure all current progress runs correctly 
or we can have one of these files for each individual branch, and make more expansive tests in this action (i reccomend this because i like automation) 
we should perhaps discuss this sometime
